Problem W — Hungarian Challenge: Minimum-Cost Perfect Matching
==============================================================

Given an `n × n` cost matrix describing the cost of assigning each of `n` jobs
to `n` workers, compute the minimum total cost assignment such that each worker
is assigned exactly one job and vice versa.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- Each of the next `n` lines contains `n` integers `c_{i,j}` (0 ≤ c_{i,j} ≤ 10^9)
  describing the assignment costs.

Output
------
Print one integer — the minimum possible total cost of a perfect matching.

Notes
-----
Use the Hungarian algorithm or min-cost max-flow.  Beware of 64-bit overflow
when summing large costs.
