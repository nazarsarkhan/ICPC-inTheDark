Problem F — Dynamic Programming Primer: Fewest Coins for a Target
=================================================================

Given a target value and a set of coin denominations, determine the minimum
number of coins required to make the target exactly.  If it is impossible,
report so.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `S` and `m` (1 ≤ S ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 50).
- The second line contains `m` distinct positive integers `c_j` (1 ≤ c_j ≤ 10^4).

Output
------
Print the minimum number of coins needed to form `S`.  If no combination of the
coins totals `S`, print `-1`.

Notes
-----
Classical unbounded coin change can be solved with dynamic programming in
\(O(S·m)\) time.
