Problem N — Directed Graph Depth: Counting Strongly Connected Components
=======================================================================

Given a directed graph, compute how many strongly connected components it has.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 300 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n)
  describing a directed edge from `u` to `v`.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the number of strongly connected components.

Notes
-----
Kosaraju's, Tarjan's, or Gabow's algorithms solve this in linear time.
