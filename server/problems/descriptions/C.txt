Problem C — String Cleansing Drill: Palindrome Ignoring Noise
=============================================================

Determine whether an input string becomes a palindrome after deleting every
character that is not a letter or digit and ignoring case differences.

Input
-----
- A single line containing up to 200 000 printable ASCII characters.

Output
------
Print `YES` if, after removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting
letters to a common case, the string reads the same forward and backward.
Otherwise print `NO`.

Notes
-----
This is a linear-time two-pointer or filtered-string comparison problem.  Unicode
normalisation is not required; the test data stays within standard ASCII.
