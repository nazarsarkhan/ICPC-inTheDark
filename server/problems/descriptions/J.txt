Problem J — Topological Discipline: Lexicographically Minimal Ordering
======================================================================

You are given a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are labeled from 1 to `n`.
Produce a topological ordering, but among all valid orders choose the one that is
lexicographically smallest when read left to right.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n,
  u ≠ v) describing a directed edge from `u` to `v`.

Output
------
Print `n` integers separated by single spaces — the lexicographically smallest
topological ordering.  If multiple vertices are simultaneously available, always
select the smallest label.

Notes
-----
Maintain in-degrees and a min-priority queue to repeatedly pick the smallest
available vertex.
