Problem K — Greedy Graphs: Rebuilding the Kingdom's MST
========================================================

Reconstruct the minimum spanning tree of a weighted, undirected, connected
graph and output its total weight.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, n − 1 ≤ m ≤ 300 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `w`
  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 0 ≤ w ≤ 10^9) describing an undirected edge of weight `w`.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Notes
-----
Use Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm; both run efficiently with appropriate data
structures.  The input graphs are guaranteed to be connected.
