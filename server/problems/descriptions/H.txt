Problem H — Graph Exploration Basics: Counting Hidden Islands
============================================================

Treat the vertices of an undirected graph as islands.  Count how many connected
components exist.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n,
  u ≠ v) describing an undirected edge.

Output
------
Print one integer — the number of connected components.

Notes
-----
Depth-first search, breadth-first search, or a disjoint-set union structure will
all solve the problem in linear time.
