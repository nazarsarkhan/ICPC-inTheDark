Problem B — Beginner Counting Challenge: Multiples Under Watch
==============================================================

Check how many numbers in a sequence are divisible by a given value `k`.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output
------
Print one integer: the count of indices `i` such that `a_i` is divisible by `k`.

Notes
-----
Iterate once through the array and use the modulo operator.  Remember that zero
is divisible by every non-zero `k`.
