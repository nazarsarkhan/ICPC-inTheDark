Problem V — Inclusion-Exclusion DP: Counting Perfect Bipartite Matchings
=======================================================================

You are given an `n × n` binary matrix describing edges of a bipartite graph
between `n` left vertices and `n` right vertices.  Count how many perfect
matchings exist.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- Each of the next `n` lines contains `n` integers `b_{i,j}` where each is either
  0 or 1.  Entry `b_{i,j} = 1` means left vertex `i` can match right vertex `j`.

Output
------
Print one integer — the total number of perfect matchings.

Notes
-----
An inclusion–exclusion or bitmask DP over subsets of the right side works in
\(O(n 2^n)\) time.  Answers fit in signed 64-bit integers in the tests.
