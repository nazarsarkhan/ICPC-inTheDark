Problem I — Weighted Graphs I: Single-Pair Dijkstra Mastery
============================================================

Find the minimum total weight of a path from a given start vertex `s` to target
vertex `t` in a directed graph with non-negative edge weights.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `w`
  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 0 ≤ w ≤ 10^9) describing a directed edge from `u` to `v` with
  weight `w`.
- The final line contains two integers `s` and `t` (1 ≤ s, t ≤ n).

Output
------
Print the minimum possible total weight from `s` to `t`.  If `t` is unreachable,
print `-1`.

Notes
-----
Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue runs in \(O((n + m) \log n)\) time and
handles non-negative weights.
