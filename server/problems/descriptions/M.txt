Problem M — Weighted Grids: Four-Directional Minimum-Risk Path
==============================================================

You are exploring an `n × m` grid where each cell has a risk value.  Starting at
the top-left cell (1,1), travel to the bottom-right cell (n,m).  Moving into a
cell incurs its risk value.  You may move up, down, left, or right, staying
inside the grid.  Find the minimum total risk required to reach the goal.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500).
- Each of the next `n` lines contains `m` integers `r_{i,j}` (0 ≤ r_{i,j} ≤ 10^9)
  describing the risk values.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the minimum total risk to travel from (1,1) to (n,m)
when the cost includes both the starting and ending cells.

Notes
-----
Model the grid as a weighted graph and use Dijkstra's algorithm.  The grid is
small enough that a priority queue implementation is easily fast enough.
