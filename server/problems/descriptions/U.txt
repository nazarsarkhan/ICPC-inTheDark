Problem U — Bitmask DP Finale: Exact Traveling Salesman Tour
============================================================

Given a complete weighted graph on `n` cities with `n ≤ 16`, starting from city 0
travel exactly once through every city and return to the start while minimizing
the total travel cost.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 16).
- Each of the next `n` lines contains `n` integers `d_{i,j}` (0 ≤ d_{i,j} ≤ 10^9)
  describing the symmetric distance matrix with `d_{i,i} = 0`.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the minimum possible tour cost visiting every city once
and returning to the starting city 0.

Notes
-----
Use Held–Karp style bitmask DP in \(O(n^2 2^n)\) time.
