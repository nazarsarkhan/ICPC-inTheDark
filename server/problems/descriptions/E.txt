Problem E — Prefix Mastery: Fast Range Sum Queries
==================================================

After reading an array of integers you will receive multiple queries asking for
the sum on a closed interval.  Answer every query efficiently.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 200 000).
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n),
  describing a query interval.

Output
------
For each query print the sum of `a_l + a_{l+1} + … + a_r` on its own line.

Notes
-----
Pre-compute prefix sums so every query can be answered in constant time.
