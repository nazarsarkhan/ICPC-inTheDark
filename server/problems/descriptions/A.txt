Problem A — Novice Arithmetic Warm-up: Sum a Sequence
=====================================================

You are given a list of integers and must report their total.  The task is to
ensure newcomers can read integers, handle negative values, and accumulate the
result without overflow.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000).
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output
------
Print a single integer equal to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\).

Notes
-----
A correct solution only needs linear time.  Watch out for the possibility that
the answer may not fit in 32-bit signed arithmetic.
