Problem Z — State-Augmented Dijkstra: Zero-Gravity Parity Routing
=================================================================

A transportation network uses gravity flips along some edges.  Each directed
edge has a traversal cost and a parity bit (0 meaning gravity stays the same,
1 meaning gravity flips).  Starting at vertex `s` with even parity, find the
cheapest path to vertex `t` that arrives with even parity as well.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 300 000).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains four integers `u`, `v`, `w`, and `p`
  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 0 ≤ w ≤ 10^9, p ∈ {0, 1}) describing a directed edge from `u`
  to `v` with cost `w` and parity flip `p`.
- The final line contains two integers `s` and `t` (1 ≤ s, t ≤ n).

Output
------
Print the minimum total cost to travel from `s` to `t` while ending with even
parity.  If it is impossible, print `-1`.

Notes
-----
Run Dijkstra's algorithm on an expanded state space with two parity states per
vertex.  Only the state `(t, even)` is considered a goal.
