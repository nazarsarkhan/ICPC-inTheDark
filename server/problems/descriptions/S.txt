Problem S — Advanced Flow Networks: Maximum Throughput Computation
==================================================================

You are given a directed network with capacities and need to determine the
maximum possible flow from a designated source `s` to sink `t`.

Input
-----
- The first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `s`, and `t`
  (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n, s ≠ t).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `c`
  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 0 ≤ c ≤ 10^9) describing a directed edge with capacity `c`.
  Multiple edges between the same pair of vertices may appear.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the value of the maximum flow from `s` to `t`.

Notes
-----
Dinic's or push-relabel algorithms comfortably solve the instances.  Edges are
capacitated but not necessarily symmetric.
