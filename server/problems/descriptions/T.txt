Problem T — Tree DP Masterclass: Maximum Weighted Independent Set
=================================================================

On a tree with weights on vertices, select a subset of vertices with maximum
possible total weight such that no two selected vertices are adjacent.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000).
- The second line contains `n` integers `w_i` (0 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) representing the
  weight of each vertex.
- Each of the next `n − 1` lines contains two integers `u` and `v`
  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) describing an edge of the tree.

Output
------
Print a single integer — the maximum achievable total weight.

Notes
-----
Root the tree anywhere and use DP with two states per vertex (selected or not
selected).  Watch out for large recursion depth; iterative DFS is safer.
