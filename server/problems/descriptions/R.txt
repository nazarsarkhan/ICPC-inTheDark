Problem R — Matrix-Tree Application: Counting Spanning Trees
===========================================================

Given a connected, simple, undirected graph, determine how many distinct
spanning trees it has.

Input
-----
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, n − 1 ≤ m ≤ n(n − 1)/2).
- Each of the next `m` lines contains two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n,
  u ≠ v) describing an undirected edge.  There are no multiple edges.

Output
------
Print one integer — the number of spanning trees.  The answer fits in signed
64-bit range for the tests.

Notes
-----
Use Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree Theorem: build the Laplacian matrix, delete any one
row and column, and take the determinant of the resulting minor.
