Problem X — Linear Algebra over GF(2): XOR Basis Dimension
==========================================================

Take a multiset of integers and determine the dimension of the vector space they
span over GF(2) when numbers are treated as bit vectors.  Equivalently, compute
the size of a maximal subset with pairwise XOR independence.

Input
-----
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000).
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (0 ≤ a_i < 2^60).

Output
------
Print one integer — the dimension of the XOR basis generated by the input.

Notes
-----
Perform Gaussian elimination on bits from the most significant down to the least
significant.  The number of pivots is the answer.
