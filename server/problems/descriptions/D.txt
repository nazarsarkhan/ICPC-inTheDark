Problem D — Stack Fundamentals: Fully Balanced Delimiters
==========================================================

Given a string formed only from parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces,
check whether it is fully balanced: every opening symbol must be closed by the
same type in the correct order.

Input
-----
- A single line containing between 1 and 200 000 characters drawn from `()[]{}`.

Output
------
Print `YES` if the delimiter sequence is balanced, and `NO` otherwise.

Notes
-----
Maintain a stack of open symbols and ensure that the closing characters match
and the stack is empty at the end.
