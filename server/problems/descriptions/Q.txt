Problem Q — Quadratic DP Classic: Levenshtein Edit Distance
===========================================================

Compute the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings — the minimum number
of single-character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change
one string into the other.

Input
-----
- The first line contains a string `a` (0 ≤ |a| ≤ 2000).
- The second line contains a string `b` (0 ≤ |b| ≤ 2000).
Both strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Output
------
Print a single integer: the edit distance between `a` and `b`.

Notes
-----
Standard dynamic programming fills a (|a| + 1) × (|b| + 1) table in
\(O(|a|·|b|)\) time.
